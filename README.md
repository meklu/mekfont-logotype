# mekfont-logotype

Hiya there! This repository contains my logotype font that I happen to use for
things and stuff, including my avatar and fancy shmancy keyboard. The
individual glyphs reside under the `glyphs/` directory in a reasonably named
fashion.

As of right now, this is a work in progress as I hand-author reasonable SVG
paths for the glyphs themselves.

## Building the font/doing anything at all what-so-ever

*TBD*

## What's done

- [ ] Glyphs

		- [x] Standard Latin
		- [x] åäö
		- [x] Numerals
	- [x] Symbols
	- [ ] Auxiliary keyboard imagery

- [ ] Font
	- [ ] Glyph metadata? Think baseline/spacing/etc.
	- [ ] Font generator utility/script
